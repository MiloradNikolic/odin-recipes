    <h3>Skillet Spinach Lasagna</h3>
    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than
      20 years ago, he had no idea how successful it would become. One of our
      top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best Lasagna racks up more
      than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular
      lasagna recipes on the internet for two decades. Unfortunately, John
      unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old — read all about his life and
      legacy here.

    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound Italian sausage roll</li>
      <li>8 lasagna noodles, broken into pieces</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
      <li>2 cups torn fresh spinach</li>
      <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
      <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage,
        breaking into smaller pieces, in the hot skillet until browned and
        crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Mix noodles into sausage.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce over sausage-noodle mixture;
        bring to a boil. Cover skillet, reduce heat, and simmer until noodles
        are cooked and sauce is thickened, about 25 minutes. Add spinach,
        ricotta cheese, and mozzarella cheese; cover skillet and remove from
        heat. Let lasagna stand for 5 minutes; top with Parmesan cheese.
